              <h2>Ayush Srivastava</h2>
              <br />
              <p>
                Greetings! I'm Ayush, a freshman Computer Science major at the
                University at Buffalo. My journey in the world of coding began
                early, sparking a passion that led me to create captivating
                applications, all while relishing the thrill of problem-solving.
                In recent times, my focus has been on excelling in Front-end web
                development, showcasing my proficiency in React.
                <br />
                <br />
                Beyond coding, I wear multiple hatsâ€”I'm a confident guitarist, a
                dedicated NGO leader organizing 30+ impactful events, and an 'A'
                certificate holder from the Indian NCC Naval wing. During a
                5-week IMUN internship, I honed my social media marketing and
                communication skills. Currently, I hold the position of Social
                Media Manager at QuantClub, a student-led club at the University
                at Buffalo. Adding to my diverse experiences, I am a student
                employee at Elli, a convenience store on campus. This role has
                equipped me with valuable skills such as customer satisfaction
                and thriving under pressure in a fast-paced environment.
                <br />
                <br />
                As I embark on the search for internships, my goal is to gain
                hands-on experience and further polish my skills. My journey
                reflects a harmonious blend of technology, creativity,
                leadership, and social impact. I am eager to connect with
                like-minded individuals and organizations and I am open to
                collaborating on innovative projects. Let's create something
                extraordinary together!
